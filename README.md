# Journal Sentiment Analysis with RAG

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** designed to analyze journal entries, perform sentiment analysis, and generate insightful reflections based on past emotional patterns. It integrates multiple AI components, including:

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses a fine-tuned `DistilRoBERTa` model (`j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base`) to classify emotions in journal entries.
- **Semantic Search**: Employs `FAISS` (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to retrieve similar past journal entries based on embeddings generated by `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
- **Reflection Generation**: Uses `FLAN-T5` (`google/flan-t5-large`) to generate deep insights based on past and present emotions.

## 🏗 Project Workflow
1. **Load and Preprocess Data**
   - Journal data is read from a CSV file.
   - Entries are cleaned and indexed with FAISS.
   - Sentences are converted to embeddings for efficient retrieval.

2. **Semantic Search with FAISS**
   - Given a new journal entry, the system finds the most similar past entries.
   - Similarity is based on sentence embeddings (MiniLM model).

3. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - The system determines the dominant emotion for the current and past entries.

4. **Reflection Generation (RAG)**
   - Constructs a prompt containing the user's current entry, retrieved similar entries, and their respective emotions.
   - Uses `FLAN-T5` to generate an insightful reflection on emotional patterns and trends.

5. **Report Generation**
   - Saves a structured sentiment analysis report with retrieved entries, detected emotions, and AI-generated reflections.

## 📊 Output
- **Report File (`sentiment_analysis_report.txt`)**: Contains structured insights including:
  - Date of the entry
  - Cleaned journal entry
  - Detected emotion
  - Retrieved similar past entries
  - AI-generated reflection
